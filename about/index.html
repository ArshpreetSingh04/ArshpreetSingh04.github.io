    <!-- What is srl -->
    <p>  Yaman Parasher is currently a recipient of the prestigious Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Photonic Integrated Circuits, Sensors & Networks (PIXNET), since 2019. As a part of this degree program, he had already completed his first two semesters in TeCIP Institute, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy, and currently attending his third semester at Aston University, Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Osaka University, Japan in the fourth semester to complete his master's thesis. Experience encompasses working on various in lab optical system design software tools & workbench along with expertise in modeling, design, & simulation of advanced photonic integrated circuits. Published research papers in reputed Science Cited Indexed (SCI) journals such as Elsevier, Springer, and international conference of
Optical Society of America (OSA), LAOP-2018 in Peru. Before joining this degree, he was working as a project associate from August 2018 to August 2019 at Delhi Technological University, New Delhi, India where he mainly explored the use of signal processing, communication theory, and optical techniques in designing high capacity optical multiuser/multichannel systems and networks. From mid of May 2018 to July 2018, he was selected in the international summer research intern program of AIM-HI institute, National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan. Here he worked in the Photonic Nanostructures & Devices lab under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Guo-en Chang. Here, he worked on the development of a highly reflective GeSn based resonant cavity structure in the SWIR (Subwavelength infrared) region for group IV photonic devices using COMSOL. Apart from this, he was also able to develop expertise in working with fabrication processes like Photolithography & RIE(Reactive Ion Etching) for various MEMS-based applications.He received Integrated B.Tech (Electronics & Communication Engineering) + M.Tech (Wireless Communication & Networks) from the School of ICT, Gautam Buddha University in May 2018. Where apart from his regular academic projects he had done various internships related to embedded systems, telecommunication & hardware design.
&nbsp
His research interests include Integrated Optics (Photonic Integrated Circuits), Advanced & Hybrid Optical Communication Systems, Free Space Optics, Spatial Division Multiplexing, Ultradense Wavelength Division Multiplexing, Other Research Interest includes Machine Learning, Big Data, Embedded Systems, IoT.
