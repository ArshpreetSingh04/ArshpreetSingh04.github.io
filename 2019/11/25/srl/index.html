  <!-- What is srl -->
<p>This summer intern project was started in July 2020, under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Piero Castoldi (Full Professor in Telecommunications at Scuola Superiore Santâ€™Anna in Pisa & Vice-Director of the TeCIP Institute) under a joint project of TeCIP with Telecom Italia(TIM). </p>  &nbsp

        &nbsp
<p>In this project, we create a service that can help to keep a track of the emergency vehicle with respect to the user's vehicle. I believe that when it comes to emergency response, every second count. For emergency response vehicles, meandering through busy intersections and gridlocked streets can present serious consequences for the person in need of care. </p>
 &nbsp
<p>In this project, we try to build a part of a smart traffic management system that can help to address this type of emergency scenario. The idea is to ensure that the user's vehicle who needs immediate assistance will be able to trace the real-time route & movement and connect to the Emergency Vehicle (ambulance) as soon as possible. </p>
 &nbsp
<p>Implementation details of the project can be found in this report. The complete source code for this demonstration can be accessed here.</p>
 &nbsp
<h2 id="">Conclusion</h2>
Considering the fact that an ambulance stuck in traffic is a common sight in many places across the world every day, truly smart transportation infrastructure is the need of the hour and this demonstration may pave the way to achieve that. Although our work does not take into account many of the real-world scenarios, and also may not work for very complex routes (such as traffic signals along a zigzag road), it is hoped that the city and town planning authorities can consider this while building smart cities for the future. </p>
